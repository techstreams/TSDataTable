# TSDataTable

**TSDataTable** is a simple, elegant data table publishing tool for [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) &amp; [Sites](https://gsuite.google.com/products/sites).  

![](img/Diagram9.png)


**TSDataTable** employs [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) inside a [Google Sheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) to retrieve data from the *first sheet*, filter the data based on hidden rows and columns, cache the data to speed loading and display data in a nicely formatted, paginated and searchable data table.   This data table can be published as a web application.

**TSDataTable** display options are configurable and the resulting published web application can be viewed standalone or [embedded](https://support.google.com/sites/answer/90569) in [Google Sites](https://gsuite.google.com/products/sites).

**TSDataTable** is intended for data table publishing within a [G Suite for Business](https://gsuite.google.com/solutions/) or [G Suite for Education](https://edu.google.com/products/gsuite-for-education) domain.

## Getting Started

<br>

### Installation

* Login to **[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)**

* Access **[TSDataTable](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18RfAnhgNqKR1edRGVSGLO84r87Rfd5WxpNH3dfxj1Ew/copy)**

* Click the ***Make a copy*** button. _This will copy the **TSDataTable** host Google Sheet to your Google Drive._

<br>

### Table Data

**TSDataTable** retrieves data from the *first sheet* of the Google Sheet and uses the *first* row of data as the **table column headings** in the resulting table display.  

To add, delete or change the order of the table data columns or rows [add, delete or move columns/rows](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/54813) in Google Sheets.

*If you would like to display another sheet of data, move that sheet to the first position in the Google Spreadsheet and clear the data cache using the table configuration options (see instructions below).*

### Data Table Column Alignment

To align data in the table columns, [align](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/46973) the corresponding column header in the *first row* of the Google Sheet.

### Configuration

**TSDataTable** configuration is accessed through the host Google Sheet menu ***TSDataTable*** → ***Configure Data Table***. 

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

* The first time the configuration dialog is opened *(or the table data retrieved after the cache has expired)* there will be a delay before the dialog displays.

* If you encounter a problem displaying the configuration dialog, close the dialog and re-open it.

* Follow the steps in [Deploying a script as a web app](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/web#deploying_a_script_as_a_web_app) with the following changes:
  * Under ***Execute the app as:*** → select your account
  * Under ***Who has access to the app:*** → select ***Anyone within "your domain"***
  
To access the published data table, use the URL from ***Current web app URL*** section of the publishing dialog above *(URL that ends in `/exec`)*.  Also use this URL to embed the published data table in a Google Site *(see next section)*.

<br>

### Embed Published Data Table in a Google Site

Once the data table has been published, it can be embedded in the ***new*** version of Google Sites.  Follow the instructions [adding content from another website](https://support.google.com/sites/answer/90569) on the Google Sites documentation.  

*__TIP!__ By controlling the size of the embed area in the Google Site, you can control additional viewing of the data table.*

## Important Notes

* **TSDataTable** is intended for internal use within a [G Suite for Business](https://gsuite.google.com/solutions/) or [G Suite for Education](https://edu.google.com/products/gsuite-for-education) domain.

* **TSDataTable** caches data for up to 6 hours to speed table display.  When the cache expires the table data will be retrieved once again and the cache repopulated.  The cache can be manually cleared prior to the 6 hours expiration to pick up new data and table configuration changes.

* **TSDataTable** is not meant to be used with large data sets.  If you receive errors for exceeding the cache quota or the table takes to long to load, you may need a more robust solution like [App Maker](https://developers.google.com/appmaker/).

* **TSDataTable** may not display all sheet data (e.g. [cell images](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9224754)).

* **TSDataTable** works with the ***new*** version of Google Sites.
